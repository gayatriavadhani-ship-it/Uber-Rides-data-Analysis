I recently completed an interactive Power BI dashboard inspired by Blinkit-style colors and theme — focused on analyzing Uber ride performance across multiple cities in India.

🎯 Goal: To identify key insights such as the most used vehicle, top city for rides, payment preferences, and overall trip trends.

📊 Key Highlights:

SUV emerged as the most used vehicle type

Pune recorded the highest number of rides

Cash was the topmost payment method

Over 3M total revenue and 160K total distance covered

Average rating: 4 ⭐ across all rides

🎨 The dashboard combines vibrant Blinkit-inspired gradients with clean visuals — including KPI cards, donut charts, and bar charts — to tell a clear story in a single glance.

🧠 I also practiced DAX measures using:

VAR, TOPN, SUMMARIZE, and CONCATENATEX for dynamic KPIs

Proper Fact–Dimension modeling and relationships for performance

📈 Learning Outcome:
This project helped me strengthen my DAX logic, visual storytelling, and UI design skills. It was rated 8.8/10 in analysis — placing me at an advanced Power BI level.

🚀 Excited to keep improving my skills and build more real-time dashboards!
